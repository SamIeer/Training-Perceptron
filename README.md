<h1>What is a Perceptron?</h1>
<p>The perceptron is the basic building block of a neural network.</p><br>
<p>It's a simple computational model that takes several inputs, applies weights to them, adds a bias, and produces an output.</p><br>
<p>It's essentially a decision-making unit.</p><br>

<h1>Real-life Analogy</h1>
<ul>Imagine you're trying to decide whether to go outside based on:</ul>
<l>Is it sunny?</l>
<l>Is it the weekend?</l>
<l>Are you free today?</l>

<ul>You assign importance (weights) to each factor:</ul>
<l>Sunny: 0.6</l>
<l>Weekend: 0.3</l>
<l>Free: 0.8</l>

<h3>You combine these factors to make a decision: Go or Not Go.</h3>
<h3>This is what a perceptron does.</h3>

<h1>Perceptron Formula</h1>
<p>A perceptron takes inputs (x1, x2, ..., xn), multiplies each by its corresponding weight (w1, w2, ..., wn),</p><br>
<p>adds a bias (b), and passes the result through an activation function.</p><br>
<p>y = f(w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wn*xn + b)</p><br>
